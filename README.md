A personal chess statistics summary tool to help with profile analysis
Just like spotify wrapped, i am creating this repository named "chess wwrapped" which has the goals divided in two levels:
First level: The code will take the pgn from all the games played divided on the basis of type (bullet, blitz, rapid, classical) and it is gonna use the lichess api initially and give you the stats of openings played with black/white, the accuracy of those openings (compared with stockfish or any leading chess engine) and then the win/loss/draw rate. This will determine if i am playing that opening correctly or not and also predict the step at which i am making the most mistakes.
Second level: The code will predict the type of moves i am blundering most of the times and it will predict the move i should rather play, it will also analyse my openings and give me the best moves.
